# Installation Statistics

## Installation statistics for specific project

You can view the installation count of your project by visiting this URL:

```
https://instl.sh/OWNER/REPO
```

You can also create a badge of your project's total installation count:

<pre><code>Base URL: https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://instl.sh/stats/OWNER/REPO/badge/shields.io

<strong>Markdown: 
</strong>![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://instl.sh/stats/OWNER/REPO/badge/shields.io)

HTML:
&#x3C;img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://instl.sh/stats/OWNER/REPO/badge/shields.io" />
</code></pre>

You can customize the badge by passing options to shields.\

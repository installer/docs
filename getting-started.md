# Getting Started

Instl generates installation scripts for your GitHub projects via a public accessible API.

```
                     ┌ The GitHub username of the project
                     |        ┌ The GitHub repository name of the project
                     |        |       ┌ The platform, see "Valid Platforms"
                     |        |       |
https://instl.sh/username/reponame/platform
```

The generated scripts, can be used by your users very easily.
